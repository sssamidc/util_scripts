1 minute interval. All of them use `sar` utility with various switches to gather
relevant information.

## What's the use for these scripts?

These scripts allow for system benchmarking by measuring CPU, memory, network and disk consumption over
given duration of time. Analyzing these data points give us better insights of the load on the system.
Moreover, it also allows us to put upper cap on application resource utilization. Lastly, it allows us
to write better software by improving performance through iterative release cycles.

## How to run these scripts?
